# Copilot Instructions (resume workspace)

- Keep resume copy concise and leadership-forward.
- Prefer 4–6 high-signal bullets per role; avoid internal codenames and long process descriptions.
- Preserve only metrics already present in the resume unless the user provides new ones.
- For writing/publications, prefer a short “Featured Writing” list (4–6) with real canonical URLs (blog/CSS-Tricks/HackerNoon).
- When making edits, verify the HTML renders by opening `index.html`.
